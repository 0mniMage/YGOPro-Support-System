## Installation
Download the server, run it. Thats it. Users may now connect to and play games on the server. There is a configuration file feel free to fiddle with it. (Config in development hince vagueness)

## Licensing and Contributing
This software was developed and designed to help the Yu-Gi-Oh! Online community which for years has been socially suffering. In line with that to protect the community this project is 'mostly open'. This software can not be used at scale without my written permission. That means no more than 10 users. There is a very speific use case I have in mind where I will not give out an an GPL if asked. For Companies and major community leaders. I've seen this software abused I do not want to see that happen again.

##Donations
Donations go to our opted-in staff memebers that work on the project. They pay taxes on it.
