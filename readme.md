#YGOPro Support System
by Salvation Development

Salvation Development is a large scale social engineering non-profit project to tackle the 'wicked problem' of Yu-Gi-Oh! Online Simulators. To do so it imploys a merit of interconnected support software based around the core software of YGOPro, WordPress, and IRC housed in this repository. The project addresses administrator megalomania, maximixing the allowance of ad hoc cliques for social stablity, extremely high public project oversight, developer negligence, mixed private and public funding, and automation at all levels except deck constuction. The following facilitates this:
* A server system based on NodeJS 
* A server GUI based on node-webkit
* node-webkit based YGOPro Launcher
* Mirco unit automatic update system, self update only what it needs, no versioning.
* Checkmate Server Access
* YGOPro settings Control UI
* Forum Intergration

YGOCore not included

## Planned Features & Goals
* Automatic redeployment based on community activity
* IRC intergration
* Web browser launcher/client
* Launcher-Client persistent settings control
* Format specific card pools
* TCG rule support

It isnt our goal to be the best simulator as far as feature sets, we have a defined system in mind that is not a reproduction of any other simulator or official game. It is something unique inspired from all previous system taking the best elements and working them into something each type of duelist can appreciate.


## Installation
Download the server, run it. Thats it. Users may now connect to and play games on the server. There is a configuration file feel free to fiddle with it. (Config in development hince vagueness)

## Licensing and Contributing
This software was developed and designed to help the Yu-Gi-Oh! Online community which for years has been socially suffering. In line with that to protect the community this project is 'mostly open'. This software can not be used at scale without my written permission. That means no more than 10 users. There is a very speific use case I have in mind where I will not give out an an GPL if asked. For Companies and major community leaders. I've seen this software abused I do not want to see that happen again.

##Donations
Donations go to our opted-in staff memebers that work on the project. They pay taxes on it.
